Audio
I have a USB microphone and I'm trying to record sound with it. I can see it with lsusb. I chose it in alsamixer, set capture to 100 and auto gain control to off, then saved with sudo alsactl store 1 (1 is the correct card number). Then issued arecord -D plughw:1 --duration=10 -f cd -vv ~/rectest.wav. I played the resulting sound file with aplay ~/rectest.wav but there was no sound. Any ideas?

liste devices: aplay -l
