Files and code related to the Pi Zero W Camera Trap for Gwen

Slightly modify this for initial setup : https://github.com/initialstate/pi-zero-w-motion-sensor/wiki/Part-1.-Setting-Up-the-Pi-Zero-W

We are not going to sue PIR, but we will use circular I/O

We also want to start audio recording once motion is detected and the recording is triggered.

We (might) also grab a still image which we might later upload to Rekognition/AWS.

We are going to have to add at least one push botton (for power off). Maybe some others for setting modes etc without having to connect.

We want bluetooth to be on and allow recovery of files but *only* from a trusted device

We want ad-hoc wifi so we can connect over SSH


# Ben needs to spend a couple of hours tidying up all the various crud he has collected for this repo. :)
